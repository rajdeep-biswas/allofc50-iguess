            <h5>Another head hangs lowly<br />
Child is slowly taken<br />
And the violence, caused such silence<br />
Who are we mistaken?<br /><br />
But you see, it's not me<br />
It's not my family<br />
In your head, in your head, they are fighting<br />
With their tanks, and their bombs<br />
And their bombs, and their guns<br />
In your head, in your head they are crying<br /><br />
In your head, in your head<br />
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br />
What's in your head, in your head<br />
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh</h5>
